## ðŸš€ About Me
Iâ€™m a data science student based in Dortmund, Germany, originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at TU Dortmund University. I expect to complete my degree by September 2026. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from American International Universityâ€“Bangladesh. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how data drives decision-making â€” and today, Iâ€™m fortunate to be building a career around this passion.

I bring cross-industry experience through prior roles in healthcare, banking, and manufacturing. I started my career in the healthcare sector at Labaid Group, where I contributed to an ERP implementation project â€” giving me first-hand exposure to large-scale system integrations and business process optimization. Since then, I have expanded my experience through roles in the banking and manufacturing domains, gaining practical knowledge in various solutions.

Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities in data science, data engineering, or data analytics roles in Germany. My technical focus areas include building end-to-end data science solutions â€” from data extraction and processing (ETL pipelines) to model development and deployment â€” using Python, SQL, data visualization tools, and cloud platforms (currently gaining hands-on experience).

Beyond coursework and projects, I enjoy improving my German, exploring Generative AI tools and experiment with how we can leverage them to build more effective data solutions.

When I step away from the keyboard, youâ€™ll likely find me with a book in hand. Iâ€™m drawn to stories and ideas that broaden my perspective â€” personal favorites include The Alchemist, The Compound Effect, and Sei Somoy. You can find more of my reading on my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57002361-istiak-mahbub).
